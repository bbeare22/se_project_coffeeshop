## Plan on improving the project

1. Project Name - Brett Beare, Project 2 Triple Peaks Coffee Shop
2. Project #2 composed of creating a landing page for Triple Peaks Library. In this project I used HTML and CSS to structure the webpages layout and styling its elements to attract and engage visitors. I used HTML to define the page by specifying headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content such as implementing a form so visitors can make a reservation at the coffee shop. Paired with that I used CSS to stlye the page and make it more appealing to visitors such as including colors, fonts, spacing, layout and much more. The Functionality of the landing page includes a clear call to action which is to encourage more people to visit the coffee shop by showing them links to different coffee recipes the library has as well as a full menu. The page also includes responsive design elements to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experiences across different devices.
3. I really like the landing page because of its clear and modern design, in the future i'd like to add to this by learning more about styling and implementing more style to make the website more interactive. For example when you hover over buttons/ links.
